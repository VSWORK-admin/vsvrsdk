DESCRIPTION:
ArrayMaker Addon provide the ability for PlayMaker to work with ArrayLists and HashTables. 
ArrayLists and HashTables are defined as proxy components on GameObjects: They can be referenced within Fsm using a gameObject referemce, a string reference and the related custom actions.
A full set of Custom Actions is available to work with those ArrayLists and HashTables proxies. 
ArrayLists and HashTables proxies can be created at runtime within Fsm for convenience ( a set of Actions is available for this).

Features of ArrayLists and HashTables proxies: 
	* You can fill ArrayLists and Hashtables with content during authoring.
	* You can live preview and edit content of ArrayLists and Hashtables.
	* hashtable inspector check and visually warn for key duplicates.
	* during playback, you can narrow the preview given a start index and a row count, so if you have thousands of entrys, it is still manageable in the inspector.

NOTE: ArrayLists and HashTables proxy components can be used and accessed by normal scripts as well. 

More info on the PlayMaker forum dedicated section ( not yet available )
